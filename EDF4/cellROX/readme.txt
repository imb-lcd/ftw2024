After running `preprocess.ijm` to process the raw images
1. run `export.ijm` to get the microscopic images in the figure 4a and 4b
2. run `outline.m` to get the outline in the figure 4a based on the images generated by `export_for_outline.ijm`
3. run `plot_profile.m` to get the profile in the figure 4a
4. run `make_kymograph.m` to get the kymograph in the figure 4d (`mask_initiation.m`, `speed_estimation.m`, and `plotKymo.m` are called)
