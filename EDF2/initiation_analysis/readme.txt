1. run `mark_initiation.m` to get the figure 2a
2. run `plot_initiation_heatmap.m` to get the figure 2b
3. run `initiation_Poisson_dist_fitting.m` to get the figure 2c (this script uses `manual_remove_wrong_initiation.m` to remove wrong initiations)
4. run `initiation_Exp_dist_fitting.m` to get the figure 2d
