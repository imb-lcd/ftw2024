After running `preprocess.ijm` to process the raw image, 
1. run `export.ijm` to get the images in the figure 1f and 1g
2. run `outline_lipid.m` to get the outline in the figure 1f.
3. run `plot_profile.m` to get the bottom panel of figure 1f.
4. run `outline_cy5.m` to get the outline in the figure 1g.
5. run `get_slices.m` to get the figure 1h.
6. run `make_kymograph.m` to get figure 1i (`mask_initiation.m`, `speed_estimation.m`, and `plotKymo.m` are used to make the kymograph)
