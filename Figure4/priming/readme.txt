For Figure 4a, run `bifurcation_diagram.m` to compute the steady states from the model (`calculate_steady_states.m` is called) and plot figure 4a.
For Figures 4b and 4c, after running `preprocess_ros_steadystate.ijm` to process the raw images:
1. run `export_ros_steadystate.ijm` to get images in the figure 4b.
2. run `quantify_ros_staedystate.m` to get figure 4c.
