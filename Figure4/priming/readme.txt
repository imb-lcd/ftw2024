After running `preprocess_ros_steadystate.ijm` to process the raw images
1. run `export_ros_steadystate.ijm` to get images in the figure 4b.
2. run `quantify_ros_staedystate.m` to get figure 4c.
3. run `bifurcation_diagram.m` to compute the steady states from the model and plot figure 4a  (`calculate_steady_states.m` is called)
