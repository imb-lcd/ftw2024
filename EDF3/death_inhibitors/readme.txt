1. run `export_images_around_induction.ijm` to get the microscopic image of Control, Nec-1, and Z-VAD
2. run `export_dfo_fer1_lip1.ijm` to get the microscopic image of DFO, Lip-1 and Fer-1 (use `get_center_induction_dfo_fer1_lip1.ijm` to get the centroid of the photoinduction sites)
3. run `make_kymograph.m` to get the kymograph of Control, Nec-1, and Z-VAD in the figure 3k (`plotKymo.m` is called)
4. run `plot_kymograph_fer1.m` to get the kymograph of Fer-1 in the figure 3k (`plotKymo.m` is called)
5. run `summarize_speed.m` to get the figure 3l
