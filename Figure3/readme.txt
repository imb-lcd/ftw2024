1. run `preprocess.ijm` to process the raw image (need to change path)
2. run `exprot_DFO.ijm` to export the image in figure 3c (need to change path)
3. run `exprot_FAC.ijm` to export the image in figure 3e (need to change path)
4. run `make_kymograph.m` to get the kymographs in figure 3d, 3f, 3g, 3h, and 3i (need to change path)
5. run `summarize_DFO_96.m` to fit the dose response curve and plot the figure 3j.
6. run `summarize_FAC_96.m` to fit the dose response curve and plot the figure 3k.
