After running `export_for_outline.ijm` to process the raw images
1. run `export_for_outline.ijm` to get the images in the extended data figure 1d
2. run `outline.m` to get outline in the extended data figure 1d
3. run `vector_field.m` and `entropy_rpe_erastin_center2.m` to generate vector field and entropy (entropy_rpe_erastin_center2.mat)
4. the `colorcet.m` is used in `vector_field.m` to color the vectors at different time (the colorbar for vector in the figure)
